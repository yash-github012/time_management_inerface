## Introduction

The **Solo Study Tracker** is a productivity tool designed to help individuals manage their study or work sessions efficiently using the **Pomodoro Technique**. The app allows users to track study time, maintain session history, take notes, and stay focused with the help of a built-in timer. User authentication is handled through a **Node.js backend** to allow personalized experiences for each user.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Work in intervals (25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break) to maximize focus and productivity.
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and maintain personalized study sessions.
- **Session History**: Track all previous study sessions and maintain a history of completed tasks.
- **Notes and Calendar**: Add and manage notes related to study sessions using a calendar.
- **Music Integration**: Spotify integration for an enhanced study experience.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly and responsive interface designed to work on any device.

## Pomodoro Technique

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method that involves working in timed intervals. It helps maintain focus and reduce mental fatigue. Here's how it works:

1. **Select a task** to work on.
2. Set the **timer for 25 minutes** (one Pomodoro).
3. **Work** on the task for the entire duration.
4. Take a **5-minute break** after the Pomodoro session.
5. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes).

This technique boosts productivity and helps prevent burnout by incorporating regular breaks.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI/UX and modal interactions)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (handles user authentication, session management)
- **Storage**: In-memory storage for session tracking (can be extended to use databases such as MongoDB)
- **API**: Spotify music link integration for background music during study sessions
